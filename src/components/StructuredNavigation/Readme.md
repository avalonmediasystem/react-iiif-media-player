Structured navigation component.

This is an example of how we can export individual components or "features".

Need to figure out the best way to feed a sample manifest in here for documentation...

```js static
import { StructuredNavigation } from 'react-iiif-media-player';
```

```jsx inside Markdown
import mockData from '../../json/mahler-symphony-audio.js';

<StructuredNavigation manifest={{ foo: 'Need to figure this out' }} />;
```
