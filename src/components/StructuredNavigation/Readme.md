Structured navigation component. Need to figure out the best way to feed a sample manifest in here for documentation...

```js static
import { StructuredNavigation } from 'react-iiif-media-player';
```

```jsx padded
<StructuredNavigation manifest={{ foo: 'Need to feed in a sample manifest' }} />
```
