00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Live this-- what I
consider a [INAUDIBLE] life

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.030 align:middle line:90%
with three children, the wife.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And very necessary to
maintain it at all times

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.790 align:middle line:84%
because I feel there is no place
for structures in my studio.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.850 align:middle line:90%
There is no place for rules.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's where one
can, if you will,

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.930 align:middle line:84%
experience certain
kinds of madness.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.540 align:middle line:90%
My art is about my life.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.860 align:middle line:84%
I feel that I needn't paint
about anything outside of it

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.648 align:middle line:90%
because it's--

00:00:52.648 --> 00:00:54.940 align:middle line:84%
if one could spend their life
painting about something,

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really intend to spend
mine painting about myself.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.480 align:middle line:90%
It's like a very long voyage.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.940 align:middle line:84%
I do what I do
because I have to.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.770 align:middle line:90%
I can't stop myself.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And I find that reason to
be about as interesting

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.280 align:middle line:90%
as any for making anything.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.700 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.570 align:middle line:84%
My art does deal with the
things I am familiar with--

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.000 align:middle line:84%
everyday objects,
parts of my body,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.410 align:middle line:84%
parts of my wife's
body, the tools I

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.720 align:middle line:84%
grew up with, the bathrooms
in my uncle's store.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Those things are not done
as comments on our times.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I never think about
making art like that.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm more interested
in commenting

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.070 align:middle line:90%
on them as things I like.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.780 align:middle line:84%
The more I learn
about myself, the more

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.890 align:middle line:84%
I seem to have time
to put it into my art.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is,
being psychoanalyzed

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
has liberated me from
all the sort of crud that

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.610 align:middle line:84%
encrusts people from doing all
the things they want to do,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.700 align:middle line:84%
or being able to think
clearly about things,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.240 align:middle line:84%
or to have the time to do all
the things you want to do.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it
has done for me.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.281 align:middle line:84%
It's made my life
much less cumbersome.

00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:35.177 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:35.177 --> 00:02:40.050 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.410 align:middle line:84%
His work is tough, tough to
know because he pushes it

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:84%
into areas of taste and
feeling and handling

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.640 align:middle line:84%
and subject beyond
that of other painters.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
Jim Dine, born in
Cincinnati, Ohio, 1935.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.030 align:middle line:84%
As part of the struggle with
the reality that surrounds him,

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Dine's painting is continually
concerned with objects,

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.050 align:middle line:84%
like his outspokenly
autobiographical series

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:90%
on pallets.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.430 align:middle line:90%


00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And I made the
first palettes then.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Because all these things--
it was the first time

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.260 align:middle line:84%
I really consciously
thought about myself.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.758 align:middle line:84%
And the first palette was
called The 1935 Palette.

00:03:16.758 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, last night,
someone was telling me

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.568 align:middle line:84%
that they had an exhibit
at some university,

00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle line:90%
and they were hanging it.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And they saw behind
it, it said in honor

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.550 align:middle line:90%
of the artist's birthday.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I really
consciously realized

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.770 align:middle line:84%
that this is what I really
wanted to talk about,

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.370 align:middle line:90%
was myself.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.630 align:middle line:84%
So in 1935-- it was in honor
of the date of my birth.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.430 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.750 align:middle line:90%
And then I got--

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:84%
from the palletes,
I opened up more,

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and I started to make
paintings of ties and coats.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Paintings like the ties bluntly
presented isolated, almost

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.500 align:middle line:84%
rude objects, forcing us,
if we bothered to look,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.550 align:middle line:84%
to a reconsideration not
so much of the object,

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.550 align:middle line:90%
but of ourselves.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Painters pushing out,
making discoveries

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:84%
have always enraged
the sensibilities

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.000 align:middle line:90%
of their audience.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Jim Dine, for
example, found himself

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.230 align:middle line:90%
in the pages of Life Magazine.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%
The scene scurried after
him, and in its discomfort,

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.959 align:middle line:90%
made him famous.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:84%
I made a painting
with a Derby hat

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.850 align:middle line:84%
and then a real Derby
hat underneath of it,

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.722 align:middle line:90%
like redundant.

00:04:24.722 --> 00:04:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes, at
that point in particular,

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.320 align:middle line:90%
I didn't trust things.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And if I made a painting of a
shoe and wrote shoe under it,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.900 align:middle line:90%
I felt it really got it across.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.315 align:middle line:84%
And also, it was a
way of being dumb,

00:04:35.315 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:90%
which I liked at that time.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.485 align:middle line:84%
After the show of
ties and coats,

00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:47.860 align:middle line:84%
in about three
months after that,

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:84%
I made about 30
paintings of tools.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:90%
It was a great burst.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.310 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.920 align:middle line:84%
His grandfather was in the
plumbing supply business,

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:84%
and his father owned
a hardware store.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.093 align:middle line:90%
He grew up with tools.

00:05:01.093 --> 00:05:03.385 align:middle line:84%
And in the span of his work,
they are the one constant.

00:05:03.385 --> 00:05:06.490 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.830 align:middle line:84%
If the familiar world
of ties and shoes

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and pliers and
hammers and wrenches

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.810 align:middle line:84%
can be such a mysterious,
awkward, and tasteless place,

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.490 align:middle line:90%
how safe are we ourselves?

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:27.460 align:middle line:90%


00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.998 align:middle line:84%
From the tool paintings which
I did in the spring of 1962,

00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:35.290 align:middle line:84%
I went to East Hampton, Long
Island for the first time,

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.480 align:middle line:84%
summer, where I
now have a house.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And I experienced being able to
go into a hardware store which

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.930 align:middle line:84%
was absolutely complete
in its stock of things.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.470 align:middle line:90%
It was easy to see everything.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.790 align:middle line:84%
It was a big, roomy hardware
store, and you could browse.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.220 align:middle line:84%
You can't do that
in New York City.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:90%
And it was--

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.670 align:middle line:90%


00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.490 align:middle line:84%
I opened a charge
account, and I saw things

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.340 align:middle line:90%
that really, I felt--

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.710 align:middle line:84%
it was like they were like
naturals for the paintings.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And I bought about
six medicine chests

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.308 align:middle line:90%
without the thought of them--

00:06:12.308 --> 00:06:13.392 align:middle line:90%
what I would do with them.

00:06:13.392 --> 00:06:15.630 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is, I said, I
want six medicine chests,

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.830 align:middle line:90%
and charge it.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And towel racks, and soap
and grab, and soap dishes.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.073 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
affix them to canvas.

00:06:27.073 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was about having these
things around in your studio

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.560 align:middle line:84%
as though you had
tubes of paint.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were the beginning
of the bathroom pictures.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.740 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.720 align:middle line:84%
The bathroom pictures were
shockers, nasty things

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.640 align:middle line:84%
with disagreeable
colors and textures.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:84%
But their message was the most
uncomfortable thing about them,

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.320 align:middle line:84%
for it had something to do
with how we see ourselves,

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.830 align:middle line:90%
how we avoid ourselves.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.960 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.960 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I was making
two kinds of pictures.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.835 align:middle line:84%
One were the bathroom
pictures, and the other

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.940 align:middle line:90%
were child's rooms.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I tried to simulate on the
canvas a kind of wallpaper

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.080 align:middle line:90%
I remembered as a child--

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.910 align:middle line:84%
stars on a blue field,
silver stars and moons

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:84%
on a blue field, and
somehow talk about children

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.460 align:middle line:90%
in bed at night, I guess.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Fixing on wallpaper,
whatever that means.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.010 align:middle line:84%
From the bathrooms and the
child's rooms and the shower

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:28.872 align:middle line:84%
paintings, I went
back to palettes

00:07:28.872 --> 00:07:29.830 align:middle line:90%
in a very straight way.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to paint very hard
palettes, hard-edge palettes

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.210 align:middle line:84%
with real palette
on the palette,

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:42.570 align:middle line:84%
red against black, color charts,
very straight color chart.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.070 align:middle line:84%
I would but all the
red devil paints

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:48.210 align:middle line:84%
available in the hardware store
and rule off even squares.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:49.220 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't enough.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.270 align:middle line:90%
It was too cool.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.398 align:middle line:90%
It was too much without my hand.

00:07:54.398 --> 00:07:55.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a problem I have, I guess.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:90%
I can't maintain my cool.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:07.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm always being
sloppy, excessive.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And I made those
that spring of '63,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and in the summer of '63, made
pallets, but more painterly.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Now sensuous, now
cool, the curve

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.060 align:middle line:84%
of the palette like the
curve of the Ohio River

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:31.450 align:middle line:84%
or a woman's body, but still
the autobiographical palette

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:84%
for Dine's painting is
also about painting.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.610 align:middle line:84%
From the palettes, one morning,
I looked at the New York Sunday

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Times, and I saw an ad for a
red bathrobe on a black ground.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:90%
It had nobody in it, but--

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.190 align:middle line:84%
there was someone in it, but
they had doctored the photo,

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.670 align:middle line:84%
so it was just an empty
bathrobe standing there,

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:50.760 align:middle line:90%
red on a black ground.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.470 align:middle line:90%
And it looked like me inside.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.017 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to make a
self-portrait anyway, really

00:08:55.017 --> 00:08:56.100 align:middle line:90%
literally a self-portrait.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.980 align:middle line:84%
I thought this was the best
support for the self-portrait.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And I started superimposing
the robes on palettes

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:12.490 align:middle line:84%
and had a show, mainly of
self-portraits of robes,

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:20.690 align:middle line:84%
of bathrobes,
sometimes on pallets,

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:84%
sometimes next to color
charts, sometimes silver point

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.920 align:middle line:90%
on canvas.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes-- there was one I
had called Steven Han's Path

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.740 align:middle line:84%
which was a lying-down
bathrobe on its side

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.945 align:middle line:84%
with a 10-foot log
in front of it.

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:40.820 align:middle line:84%
It was a tree I cut down
on Steven Han's path

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.480 align:middle line:90%
in East Hampton, Long Island.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And I put the axes
into the tree.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And a painter I know saw
the painting, and he said,

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.110 align:middle line:90%
he's so independent.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Don't you want to put a
little red from the robe

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.060 align:middle line:84%
onto the log in front
of it or something?

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And I realized-- I mean,
I trust objects so much.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:02.650 align:middle line:84%
I trust disparate
elements going together.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever questions
glasses on a person's face.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:10.900 align:middle line:84%
No one's ever thought of
making skin-colored glasses.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.030 align:middle line:84%
I think anything goes
next to another thing.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:90%
It's just what you bring to it.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, after those paintings,
I started to make sculpture.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.980 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think I could
paint for a while.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I cast a pair of leather
motorcycle boots in plaster,

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.300 align:middle line:90%
then cast aluminum.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I made a bench of them,
made a boot bench.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I made two long
boots lying down.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.940 align:middle line:84%
I've made about 15 pieces
of sculpture up to now--

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.430 align:middle line:84%
a ribbon machine,
which I felt related

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.940 align:middle line:84%
to the color charts, another
ribbon machine, an ax,

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:51.762 align:middle line:90%
hammer doorway, some hands.

00:10:51.762 --> 00:10:56.208 align:middle line:90%


00:10:56.208 --> 00:11:00.654 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:00.654 --> 00:11:11.030 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And I had this idea of making
furniture that was useless

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:20.270 align:middle line:84%
or that was sculpture and
was furniture too, or--

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.160 align:middle line:84%
very little on the
furniture side,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.600 align:middle line:90%
more on the sculpture side.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So I cast my wife's
torso in plaster.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure I didn't do it
right, but it worked.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.405 align:middle line:90%
And I had this beautiful cast.

00:11:36.405 --> 00:11:38.030 align:middle line:84%
It was extraordinary-looking
in itself.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And so then I had
this thing, and I

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.860 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what to do with it.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.633 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well, it
could be a terrific table.

00:11:46.633 --> 00:11:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
I had was I was

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.990 align:middle line:84%
going to cast it in Lucite,
clear Lucite, the whole thing.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:57.390 align:middle line:84%
But I felt that was a bit like
Laverne furniture somehow.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And so then finally, I got a
cast in bronze in the table.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Jim Dine makes but one
cast from his sculpture.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:07.740 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.830 align:middle line:90%
That's enough.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.008 align:middle line:90%
I feel about my sculpture--

00:12:12.008 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't make two paintings,
the same kind of paintings.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't like that idea, that
whole Lipschitz business,

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:20.190 align:middle line:84%
that Rodan stuff and all
that crap, one over nine,

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:23.366 align:middle line:90%
one over 90, whatever it means.

00:12:23.366 --> 00:12:28.210 align:middle line:84%
I'll put it in my
show, and then I

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:84%
don't know what
will happen to it.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.530 align:middle line:84%
The sculptures are
so much different,

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:35.958 align:middle line:84%
I think, in feeling
than my paintings,

00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.000 align:middle line:84%
because my paintings seem
to be layers of things.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And this bout with
sculpture I had,

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:44.090 align:middle line:84%
because it was a molding
technique, a casting technique

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and things, is all
about one thing.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.850 align:middle line:84%
It's about an object I made,
an object-- a sculpture table,

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.670 align:middle line:84%
a boot bench, a boot,
three hats, whatever.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And so hence, they've kind
of lived by themselves

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:90%
very independently.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure
all the times that's

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.390 align:middle line:90%
completely satisfying to me.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to show
them all together.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.910 align:middle line:90%
It's enough.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to make anymore
sculpture for a while, anyway.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:11.850 align:middle line:90%
I did what I wanted to do.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:18.900 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:22.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what this
whole commercial world means

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:26.540 align:middle line:84%
to all of us, to
myself, and to my peers,

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:31.980 align:middle line:84%
because I see a hesitancy
to change on their parts.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.290 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:36.940 align:middle line:84%
On my part, I think,
it's very hard

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.090 align:middle line:84%
to turn the corner
here, it seems to me,

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.590 align:middle line:90%
at this point in our lives.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:45.020 align:middle line:90%


00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm more interested
in this point

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:51.930 align:middle line:84%
at doing what I want to
do, not keeping to a theme,

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.760 align:middle line:84%
not making everybody
comfortable by saying,

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.290 align:middle line:84%
oh, yes, he's the
man who does ties.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:58.985 align:middle line:90%
He's the man who does bathrobes.

00:13:58.985 --> 00:14:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm really interested
in talking about myself,

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.000 align:middle line:84%
but really without
all the accouterments

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:90%
I've used up to now.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
that means exactly

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.190 align:middle line:90%
because I haven't done it yet.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:21.590 align:middle line:84%
I do know it doesn't mean
being Jim Dine, a pop artist.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:28.354 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean being Jim Dine,
one of the takeover generation.

00:14:28.354 --> 00:14:33.190 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean Jim
Dine, a new talent.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.500 align:middle line:84%
It means being by
myself, I think,

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:45.550 align:middle line:84%
and trying to do something
that will be able to--

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:84%
that I will be able to
talk as freely in my art,

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:84%
have a dialogue
with my art as, say,

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.820 align:middle line:84%
certain poets are able
to sing very freely.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.767 align:middle line:84%
I'd like that situation
of my art now.

00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm not interested
in being a master.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm not interested in having a
school because it's not my way.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.975 align:middle line:90%
I realize that.

00:15:16.975 --> 00:15:19.517 align:middle line:84%
I was interested in that once
because, I mean, what the hell?

00:15:19.517 --> 00:15:20.100 align:middle line:90%
It's secure.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:84%
It's followers, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:27.840 align:middle line:84%
But I feel more than ever
like the man in the cold.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:32.940 align:middle line:84%
I feel very persona non
grata in the art scene.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I feel-- well, I feel very much
against the grain of things.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously,
I'm not in the--

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm not in the Barbara
Rose, Frank Stella school.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a Castelli man.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a company man.

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:44.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a realist.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm not an abstract
expressionist.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even a pop
artist, really.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Lichtenstein,
Rosenquist, Oldenburg,

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Wesselmann, and Warhol
are pop artists.

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:90%
They deal with popular imagery.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.590 align:middle line:84%
I just happen to
live at this time

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.613 align:middle line:84%
and know them and happen
to use certain things which

00:15:58.613 --> 00:16:00.780 align:middle line:84%
could be called popular
imagery, but no more anyway,

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.113 align:middle line:90%
so what difference does it make?

00:16:02.113 --> 00:16:02.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm just me.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.012 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
way it's gotta be.

00:16:05.012 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
very unpleasant,

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.730 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes it's very nice.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:09.470 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:90%
It's as complicated as that.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.390 align:middle line:90%


00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:18.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't care any longer
about the avant garde per se.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:19.520 align:middle line:90%
It's meaningless.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.770 align:middle line:90%
It's too easy to be--

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.800 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.167 align:middle line:90%
it's too easy to be a shocker.

00:16:28.167 --> 00:16:29.750 align:middle line:84%
You can be a movie
star all your life,

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.000 align:middle line:90%
and you can never do any work.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.720 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I've had being a
starlet, and that

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.910 align:middle line:90%
doesn't interest me at all.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.610 align:middle line:84%
I found that people wanted
to see me rather than they

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.120 align:middle line:90%
wanted to see my paintings.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole thing in New
York particularly now.

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:47.950 align:middle line:90%
They want to see you.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:49.575 align:middle line:84%
They want to see how
your wife dresses.

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:50.890 align:middle line:90%
They want to see--

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.840 align:middle line:84%
are you wearing
[INAUDIBLE] boots?

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.460 align:middle line:90%
Does he wear lipstick?

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Has he had his teeth capped?

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.168 align:middle line:90%
CBS would call me.

00:16:59.168 --> 00:17:01.210 align:middle line:84%
ABC would call me Will
you be on this panel show?

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Will you be on that panel
show with Lichtenstein,

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:03.725 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera?

00:17:03.725 --> 00:17:04.650 align:middle line:90%
And I said no.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.692 align:middle line:84%
And I probably cut my
own throat that way,

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:08.109 align:middle line:84%
in a kind of public
relations way,

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:11.160 align:middle line:84%
because they stopped
calling, I noticed.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.930 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
I'm involved in.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:17.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm only 30, and I don't
know what I'm doing yet.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And I sometimes get a slight
inkling of what I'm doing.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And that comes from
growing and making

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.420 align:middle line:84%
a backlog of ideas and images
and experiencing certain things

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.470 align:middle line:90%
in your art.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So what the hell
does the fame mean?

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:31.530 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean anything.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I live pretty good,
but I always lived good.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.990 align:middle line:84%
I was making $4,000 a
year as a schoolteacher.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.835 align:middle line:90%
We lived damn good.

00:17:37.835 --> 00:17:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't have
as many suits.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.627 align:middle line:84%
Nancy didn't have
as much clothes.

00:17:40.627 --> 00:17:43.600 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have steak every
night, but we ate damn well.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.540 align:middle line:90%


00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Most of my friends
aren't painters.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:52.510 align:middle line:84%
I find I relate
much more to the--

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:56.572 align:middle line:84%
to people who have
kids my age, to people

00:17:56.572 --> 00:17:58.030 align:middle line:84%
who are interested
in civic things,

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.710 align:middle line:84%
or interested in the
school I'm interested in,

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:90%
or that kind of stuff.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.805 align:middle line:84%
And I'm interested
in showbiz types.

00:18:04.805 --> 00:18:06.680 align:middle line:84%
I really like them much
better than painters.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.030 align:middle line:84%
They're much more
interesting, you know.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.848 align:middle line:84%
And I think in another
life, I would rather

00:18:10.848 --> 00:18:11.640 align:middle line:90%
have been an actor.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:16.110 align:middle line:90%


00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.170 align:middle line:84%
The most recent
theater piece I did--

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:19.790 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't done one,
as I said before.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.525 align:middle line:84%
I stopped them when we were all
doing the happenings because I

00:18:22.525 --> 00:18:23.650 align:middle line:90%
thought they were too chic.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.192 align:middle line:84%
Well, then last spring, I had
the opportunity to do one again

00:18:26.192 --> 00:18:29.320 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] and Oldenburg at
this theater rally in Whitman.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And I made a piece called
Natural History, then

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.200 align:middle line:90%
in parentheses, The Dreams.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.474 align:middle line:90%
And it was--

00:18:35.474 --> 00:18:39.088 align:middle line:84%
I used exposure of
myself as a medium.

00:18:39.088 --> 00:18:40.380 align:middle line:90%
I knew people wouldn't like it.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.593 align:middle line:84%
They'd say they were bored when
they meant they were nervous.

00:18:43.593 --> 00:18:44.760 align:middle line:90%
They didn't want to hear it.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.150 align:middle line:84%
It's much easier to
say you're bored.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And they said things
like, well, we

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.900 align:middle line:90%
don't want to see his problems.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.580 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
see his problems.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, he's
copped out from art.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.110 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that exposure
can be used as a medium,

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.025 align:middle line:84%
and I was totally
pleased with what I did.

00:18:59.025 --> 00:19:00.650 align:middle line:84%
It was completely
successful because it

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:04.060 align:middle line:84%
was about exposing
yourself, making

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:84%
it difficult for the
audience through exposure,

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.660 align:middle line:84%
asking them to relate
to you, whether you're

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.370 align:middle line:90%
relating to them.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.960 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Jim Dine was instrumental in the
shaping of a new American art

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.260 align:middle line:90%
form--

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.900 align:middle line:84%
happenings, a kind of
living art grown out

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.840 align:middle line:84%
of the need for closer contact
with a viewer, the need

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.025 align:middle line:90%
to speak more directly.

00:19:25.025 --> 00:19:30.540 align:middle line:90%


00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:84%
I was to take a girl
home for some reason.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:84%
I started walking outside, and
I knew in the distance something

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.900 align:middle line:90%
was going on.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Something was going to happen.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:44.420 align:middle line:90%


00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's get inside.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:90%
And there's a flash of light.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.920 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.920 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.235 align:middle line:90%
It's a hydrogen bomb test blast.

00:20:02.235 --> 00:20:09.655 align:middle line:90%


00:20:09.655 --> 00:20:11.525 align:middle line:84%
And I keep running
down the hallways.

00:20:11.525 --> 00:20:18.660 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's go up as far as
we can go so that we--

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.615 align:middle line:84%
when the all clear sounds,
we can beat the crowd

00:20:23.615 --> 00:20:24.240 align:middle line:90%
to the shelter.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.900 align:middle line:90%


00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.605 align:middle line:84%
Then I decided to leave,
and we walked out the door.

00:20:30.605 --> 00:20:34.565 align:middle line:90%
And the scientist says stop.

00:20:34.565 --> 00:20:40.510 align:middle line:90%


00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.710 align:middle line:90%
We've been exposed to radiation.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I have to go to
the doctor to see

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.442 align:middle line:90%
what extent the damage is done.

00:20:49.442 --> 00:20:50.861 align:middle line:90%
Am I radiated?

00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:55.130 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And the images in
the theater piece

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.190 align:middle line:84%
were only meant to
supplement the voice.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.590 align:middle line:84%
The voice-- probably if
I had any nerve at all,

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:84%
I would have just played the
tape, because the images were

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.930 align:middle line:90%
the most ephemeral part of it.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Even though to me
they were meaningful,

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.350 align:middle line:84%
I just think the tape
was powerful enough.

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:23.390 align:middle line:84%
I think a man's dreams of a
summer during one summer is--

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.092 align:middle line:90%
whoever the man is--

00:21:25.092 --> 00:21:26.310 align:middle line:90%
is so powerful.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:27.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm so--

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.670 align:middle line:84%
I trust so implicitly
and thoroughly--

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:36.982 align:middle line:84%
I trust so thoroughly the
meat of the unconscious.

00:21:36.982 --> 00:21:40.360 align:middle line:90%


00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.810 align:middle line:84%
I recently returned from
Oberlin College, where

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.020 align:middle line:90%
I was artist in residence.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.020 align:middle line:90%
I was there for 10 days.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:46.812 align:middle line:90%
I had a show there.

00:21:46.812 --> 00:21:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And I made 30 collages
while I was there.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.265 align:middle line:84%
And I once again experienced
this kind of freedom

00:21:53.265 --> 00:21:56.190 align:middle line:84%
in not being in
New York City, not

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:01.750 align:middle line:84%
having to worry about the
approval of the group.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:90%


00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.040 align:middle line:84%
From those collages,
these things

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.210 align:middle line:90%
are related-- not directly.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:11.050 align:middle line:84%
But the way I worked, I felt,
was such a natural one for me--

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:16.280 align:middle line:84%
that is, in series, one
right after the other.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, I got these seven
canvases all the same size.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:20.480 align:middle line:90%
They're 7 feet by 5 feet.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And they're called--
all of them are called

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.956 align:middle line:90%
A Period, Our Period in Oberlin.

00:22:25.956 --> 00:22:32.410 align:middle line:90%


00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.480 align:middle line:84%
I really don't paint
anymore in the old sense.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I've cut that out
almost completely.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that I have tubes
of paint around that I

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.270 align:middle line:84%
had five years ago, which
never would have been the case

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:40.895 align:middle line:90%
five years ago.

00:22:40.895 --> 00:22:41.950 align:middle line:90%
I used to paint like mad.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Now it's-- I mean, I've sprayed
all these canvases one color

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.590 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:51.220 align:middle line:84%
That is a kind of sapphire
metallic blue automobile paint.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And they're all-- there
are irregularities in them

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:57.730 align:middle line:84%
which I like, but that's because
of my bad spray techniques.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:58.760 align:middle line:90%
But I like that.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.887 align:middle line:84%
And then on that,
I'm building things.

00:23:00.887 --> 00:23:03.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm using a lot of
the elements of those things

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I've cast in the work
in other contexts

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:10.630 align:middle line:84%
because I have them around--
well, like in the one

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.840 align:middle line:84%
with the garters, with the
black elastic and things.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.315 align:middle line:84%
It has an aluminum
base on the floor which

00:23:16.315 --> 00:23:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I didn't use for a sculpture,
but it's a rectangle.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And it has an anonymity
about it that I like.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really
no one-- what is it?

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.275 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know what
the hell it is, you know?

00:23:26.275 --> 00:23:36.270 align:middle line:90%


00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And the A Period, Our Period
is the name of someone

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.720 align:middle line:84%
I knew in Oberlin
whose intensity

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:47.560 align:middle line:84%
and whose anxieties about art
and about being a human being

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.980 align:middle line:84%
were similar to
mine at that age.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And I identified with
the person and felt

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.370 align:middle line:84%
it was a way to talk about
myself through someone else.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:58.590 align:middle line:84%
It was a literary
idea, almost, I

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:00.810 align:middle line:84%
would think, which I'm more
interested in anyway now.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:03.888 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.888 --> 00:24:05.930 align:middle line:84%
I was just driving down
the street the other day,

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.090 align:middle line:90%
and I saw a red door framed.

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:09.743 align:middle line:84%
And the red just
sort of stood away,

00:24:09.743 --> 00:24:11.910 align:middle line:84%
like it was glowing, like
someone had plugged it in.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly,
[MAKES WAVING NOISE],, you

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.660 align:middle line:90%
know, like neon or something.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I was-- this looks
like that to me too.

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:19.920 align:middle line:84%
It lays out there
in its own life.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't-- that's what's nice
about this background I have.

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:26.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not like bare canvas, which
I often use, or bare paper,

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:30.078 align:middle line:84%
and then make things on it and
tear it or use the bare canvas.

00:24:30.078 --> 00:24:32.370 align:middle line:84%
That's so sensitive and
beautiful, and this is so ugly,

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:33.875 align:middle line:90%
and it's so intense.

00:24:33.875 --> 00:24:35.000 align:middle line:90%
You can't get away from it.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.890 align:middle line:84%
I've really come to hate
the surface, which I like.

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:41.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I like this sort
of hating the surface idea

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.710 align:middle line:84%
because it makes for such a
difficult thing for things

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:46.260 align:middle line:90%
to live on so that they really--

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.820 align:middle line:84%
everything you put on it
is rejected by the surface.

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:49.320 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.570 align:middle line:90%
Nothing melts in at all.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.630 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I like it.

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:55.890 align:middle line:90%
It all just hangs there.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:59.620 align:middle line:90%


00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I feel so unsettled
about what I do.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that
anything is possible.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very uncomfortable
when I make the things I make.

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And I know that people
who see them, many people

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.440 align:middle line:90%
are uncomfortable.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:84%
I never get a
middle-of-the-road reaction.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Most people say, [WRETCHES],,
it's horrible, I hate it,

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:25.990 align:middle line:84%
it makes me nervous,
or it's beautiful.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.620 align:middle line:84%
I know that the
ugliness in my art--

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:35.540 align:middle line:84%
what is called ugly is that
which is not generally thought

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:90%
of as beautiful today.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.490 align:middle line:90%


00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:44.750 align:middle line:84%
As an American growing up in a
Protestant, Puritan tradition

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:middle line:84%
of it's wrong to feel pleasure,
I'm a product of that.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:56.427 align:middle line:84%
I'm not able to experience
pleasure easily,

00:25:56.427 --> 00:25:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and it's as though
something's wrong with it

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:02.720 align:middle line:84%
if does come easy,
if it is pleasurable.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.510 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
kernels in my art--

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:07.490 align:middle line:84%
stopping the facility,
stopping the pleasure,

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.310 align:middle line:90%
and making it hard for yourself.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:13.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't want anybody to
know how well I do things

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:18.502 align:middle line:84%
because for me, it's like
my grandpa, you know?

00:26:18.502 --> 00:26:19.960 align:middle line:84%
He never felt
comfortable unless he

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.490 align:middle line:90%
went to work, even on Sunday.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:24.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's in that tradition.

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.190 align:middle line:84%
I like that thing of
pushing yourself just

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:31.720 align:middle line:84%
past the brink of it
being pleasant to do where

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:90%
you're uncomfortable doing it.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.120 align:middle line:90%
You check your facilities.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.580 align:middle line:84%
You check everything, and
you purposely find yourself.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.100 align:middle line:90%
It's about repression too.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.110 align:middle line:84%
It's about wearing
chastity belts.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:47.360 align:middle line:84%
It's about tying
yourself up with ropes.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.930 align:middle line:84%
It's about structuring
yourself with wires.

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:53.670 align:middle line:84%
All these things make
me uncomfortable.

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:57.440 align:middle line:84%
I know they make the
viewer uncomfortable.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, I think that's
the kind of thing that will--

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:90%


00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.590 align:middle line:84%
well, it's like the
Japanese potters.

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:10.028 align:middle line:84%
The best potters in
Japan, the great men

00:27:10.028 --> 00:27:12.070 align:middle line:84%
in the end of their life
feel comfortable enough,

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.750 align:middle line:84%
after making beautifully
refined things,

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.850 align:middle line:84%
to make raku ware, which
is for the tea ceremony,

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:90%
and which is thrown away.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.670 align:middle line:90%
It's just a piece of clay.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.670 align:middle line:90%
It's like that.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:22.840 align:middle line:84%
You drink the tea,
and you throw it away.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the pinnacle of
their art in ugliness,

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:30.580 align:middle line:84%
in what is called ugly in the
kind of direct, simple thing

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:34.030 align:middle line:84%
that they make in
spite of their talent,

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:38.020 align:middle line:90%
in spite of their talent.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.930 align:middle line:84%
That's much more
interesting to me.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.060 align:middle line:90%
It's like-- it's like--

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I feel like painting
a picture, and it's

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.610 align:middle line:84%
like holding my left hand,
because I'm left-handed,

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:51.415 align:middle line:84%
and not painting with
my right, but trying

00:27:51.415 --> 00:27:53.540 align:middle line:84%
to paint the picture while
I'm holding my left hand

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.840 align:middle line:84%
and trying to get it
out to paint it with.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.790 align:middle line:90%
That interests me.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.760 align:middle line:84%
I think those are
the things that--

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.850 align:middle line:84%
that's the best way
I can talk in my art.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:09.440 align:middle line:90%


00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Dine says he does what he
has to do, paints the way

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.320 align:middle line:84%
he does because there
is no other way.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And so his work is
symptomatic of the scene

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:22.220 align:middle line:84%
today, of the attitude
of many painters.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.810 align:middle line:84%
In the balance of this series on
contemporary American artists,

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.994 align:middle line:84%
we will explore this
new sensibility.
